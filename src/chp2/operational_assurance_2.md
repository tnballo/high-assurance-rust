# Operational Assurance (2 of 2)

Time for a tiny bit of client-side operational assurance.
We're going to package this chapter's code so that it "just works" in the field.

We want our `rcli` tool to run on nearly any Linux system, instantly.
Just by copying a single executable file.
No setup, no pulling in libraries with an OS-specific package manager.
We want it to work for every user, every time.

> Potentially.
> Operational assurance can be thought of as an abstract game played by defenders and attackers.
> Likewise, native executables can serve different agendas:
>
> * **Defense:** Performant, reliable tools for a range of hosts you manage (e.g. "assets").
>
> * **Offense:** Portable programs amenable to obfuscation[^Hellscape]. For hosts owned by your victims (e.g. "targets").

## Building a Free-standing Binary

Static binaries are a tried-and-true way to bundle a program and its dependencies.
They provide an alternative to dynamic linking, a default which locates and loads dependencies at runtime.
Let's briefly visualize the mechanical distinction.

With **dynamic linking**, multiple processes use the same copy of a shared dependency (e.g. shared library).
The shared functions are "resolved" (address to call into is determined) at runtime.
Typically that means on the first call a process makes to a shared function, but it can also be when the process is first "loaded" (e.g. the program is started)[^BindNow].
It's common, but not required, for shared libraries to make system calls - requests to the OS kernel to interact with hardware.
Reading or writing a file requires a system call.

  </figure>
</p>

**Static linking** takes all of the executable code needed for a program, including any services typically provided by system libraries, and bakes everything into one larger file.
The result is a stand-alone application.
No need to resolve anything at runtime.
System calls are made directly as necessary.

First, we'll verify that `rcli` is dynamically linked by default.
From the `crypto_tool/rcli` directory, run:

```ignore
cargo build --release
ldd ../target/release/rcli
```

`ldd` is a Linux command for printing shared library dependencies - those the OS distribution typically manages.
So that second command will output something like:

```ignore
linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffc0196f000)
libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f09369b9000)
/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f0936c8e000)
libpthread.so.0 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007f0936996000)
libgcc_s.so.1 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgcc_s.so.1 (0x00007f093697b000)
libdl.so.2 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 (0x00007f0936975000)
```

Each line represents a shared object (`.so` file) that the `rcli` tool expects to be present somewhere on the filesystem in order to function.

The second item (line starting with `libc.so.6`) is the C standard library.
Recall from this chapter's intro that our `rcli` front-end code links against parts of `libc` (e.g. for dynamic memory allocation).
Although our RC4 library does not (it's a `#![no_std]` component).

To avoid being reliant on the presence of these libraries, we can compile a static binary that will use `musl` (a tiny `libc` alternative[^MUSL]) instead:

```ignore
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
```

* The first command adds a new compilation target[^PlatformSupport], which is generally specified by a "target triple" in the form `{Arch}-{Vendor}-{Sys}-{ABI}`.

* The second command builds `rcli` as before, but this time for the target triple `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`.

Now let's try `ldd` again, this time on the `musl`-target binary:

```ignore
ldd ../target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/rcli
```

The output should be:

```ignore
statically linked
```

Our second build of the `rcli` executable will "just work" on any x86_64 Linux system!
All you need to do is copy over the binary.

## Stripping Debug Info

If we want to distribute this executable, we should reduce its size by removing debug information (including symbols that allow matching to source code, something a CLI end-user won't need to do).

We can "strip" the binary of this information by adding the following `release` profile setting to the workspace's configuration file, `crypto_tool/Cargo.toml`:

```ignore
[profile.release]
strip = true
```

The setting applies to any target built with the flag `--release` (which enables optimizations).
We could've also used `strip`[^Strip], a standalone Linux utility, but we leveraged `cargo` to more cleanly integrate into the build pipeline.

> Warning: unlike the `musl` route, the resulting binary might still be dynamic linked against something like `vdso`[^VDSO]. You can use `ldd` to verify.

## Takeaway

We've demonstrated building a completely free-standing tool.
Our binary will run natively, on nearly any client of given OS and ISA[^ISA].

That concludes our tour of software assurance!
In the next chapter, we'll dig into Rust proper.
