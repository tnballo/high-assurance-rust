# Software Perspective: CPU to Process

We want to build a mental model of "what the machine is doing".
Of how, at a mechanical level, a computer executes a program in memory.
Systems programmers work within the confines of this model to write efficient programs.
Exploit developers abuse it to take control of vulnerable programs.

Recall that our mental model doesn't need to reflect every intricacy of reality.
A more *complex* model isn't necessarily a more *useful* one, even if technically more accurate.
We're primarily interested in a single concept at the core of every "low-level"[^Chp1Levels] language: runtime memory management.

That entails understanding how the **stack** and the **heap**, two memory locations mentioned in the last chapter, work.
In considerable detail.
We'll start with the stack for two reasons:

1. **Ubiquity** -  Stack memory is present on every system, from the tiniest microcontroller to beefiest server. Use of heap memory is common but also optional. A non-embedded program can choose to avoid heap allocations for performance or portability, but an embedded platform may not support the heap at all. Stack memory is always at play.

2. **Simplicity** - Stack memory is implemented with hardware support, its operations are relatively simple. We can push (add) frames onto the stack and pop (remove) frames from the top. By contrast, heap memory's logic is complex and controlled by software. Stack memory can be discussed generally, but understanding heap fundamentals requires studying a specific allocator's implementation (which we'll do!).

Before we push on to stack memory proper (pun intended), we need to briefly cover two prerequisites: CPUs and program loading.
Both topics are the subjects of entire technical books, so we'll visually diagram just enough detail to scaffold our mental model of the runtime stack.

## The CPU and RAM

</p>

Main memory, a physical machine's Random Access Memory (RAM), supports all non-trivial runtime computation.
The bit-patterns it stores and operates on representations two distinct items:

* **Data** - Variable-length sequences of bytes representing any information: hardcoded strings, colors codes, numbers, entire image and video files, etc. Each byte can be addressed individually, even if word-aligned accesses are often preferable for performance.

  * Data can be written to or read from disk or network (e.g. *persistent storage*), but any programmatic update means reading the data into RAM (e.g. *volatile storage*), performing the modification, and writing it back.

* **Code** - Native CPU instructions encoded as short sequences of bytes. In the above diagram, we assume all valid instructions are the same length[^FixedLen]. A *word* is a CPU's "natural" unit of data (what its hardware is designed to operate on efficiently).

  * Instructions focus on low-level operations: arithmetic, boolean logic, condition testing, moving data in memory, etc. Arbitrarily complex programs can be broken down into long sequences of these basic operations[^MovObfu]. Assembly language is a human-readable representation of raw instruction encodings (aka "machine code").

The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is a very fast instruction processing state machine with small pieces of "scratch space" for storing intermediate results called *registers*.
Final results are written back to RAM.
Registers come in two flavors:

1. General Purpose (`GP*`) registers can store any kind of result at any time.

2. Special purpose registers (e.g. `IP`, `SP`, `CCR`) are used to track internal state during result processing.

So how does *processing* actually work?
Both the instructions and data move back and forth between the CPU and RAM via a data bus[^DataBus].
The address bus allows a CPU to specify a given memory location and size of data to be read or written.
Every CPU continually repeats a three step *instruction cycle* (try tracing each step below through the above diagram):

1. **Fetch** - Read an instruction from RAM currently addressed by the **Instruction Pointer (IP)** register[^PC]. Update the `IP` to point to the next instruction.

    * *Above diagram:* CPU sends the current `IP` value over the address bus, gets back the instruction pointed to over the data bus.

2. **Decode** - Interpret the meaning of the fetched instruction. It must include an *opcode* (unique encoding for its operation), but may also include *operands* (arguments for the operation) and/or a prefix (behavioral modifier).

    * *Above diagram:* CPU deciphers the semantics of the received instruction.

3. **Execute** - Execute the instruction to generate side-effects. Internally, this means a Control Unit (CU) passes instruction-specific signals to functional units. For example: the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a functional unit which performs mathematical operations on register values.

    * *Above diagram:* Depending on the instruction, the CPU updates `SP`, `CCR`, and `GP*` registers. Additionally:

        * If the instruction writes, the CPU sends an address to write over the address bus and data to be written over the data bus.

        * If the instruction reads, the CPU sends an address to read over the address bus and receives the corresponding data over the data bus.

Modern CPUs rely on complex optimizations, like instruction pipelining[^Pipeline] and speculative execution[^SpecExec], to speed up the instruction cycle.
Fortunately, we don't have to consider or understand such minutia when programming day-to-day.

The jobs of various registers are, by contrast, important for a working mental model.
In addition to the IP, the two special purpose registers worth noting are:

* The **Stack Pointer (`SP`)** register - the address denoting the bottom of the current stack frame. A stack frame is akin to function's in-RAM "notepad" for computing and saving *function-local* results.

    * In the statement `let x = 3 + 6;`, `x` will be computed using registers, then the value `9` will be stored on the stack[^RegisterAlloc]. This allows the CPU to re-use its small, fixed set of `GP*` registers for new computations when multiple functions are called in a program.

* The **Condition Code Register (`CCR`)** register collects the current status flag bits of a processor. Among other uses, this register helps implement conditional logic - like "jumping" the instruction pointer to a particular location if an operation's result is non-zero.

    * This single register enables all the control flow constructs[^DuffDev] we rely on as programmers, like `if` statements and `for` loops. `if z == true { do_1(); } else { do_2(); }` de-sugars to "test the equality of `z` and `true`, if equal set equality flag in `CCR`. If this equality flag in `CCR` is set, jump to `do_1()` and execute, else jump to `do_2()` and execute".

Let's recap: CPUs continually read and execute instructions from RAM, update internal registers, then read/write data from/to RAM.

With the basics of how hardware backs computation under our belt, we're almost ready to discuss  stack memory.
But first we need to understand one more concept: the process - a key OS-level abstraction.

## Executable vs Process

When a compiler outputs a program, it's represented as an executable file stored on disk.
Operating systems use different file formats to standardize the structure of executables: PE on Windows, ELF on Linux, and Mach-O on MacOS.
Every format contains sections storing:

* **A header** (start of the file for all) - contains various metadata: identifier for file type, a description of contents, the offsets of additional sections and special tables (e.g. section header tables on Linux).

* **Executable code** (`.text` section on Linux) - the instructions encoding the compiled program's logic. Most of your hard work as a programmer lives here!

* **Read-only data** (`.rodata` section on Linux) - constant values, like static strings or hardcoded lookup tables.

* **Writable data** (`.data` on Linux) - initialized, writable, global variables and buffers. Aside: uninitialized data gets its own section (`.bss` on Linux, often zero-initialized in practice).

A *process* is an instance of an executable that's currently running.
Meaning the OS has scheduled the process to receive CPU time, the executable bytes will churn through our aforementioned fetch/decode/execute cycle.

An OS's loader takes the contents of an on-disk executable, places them into memory, and prepares that memory for program execution.
A linker may also be involved to combine various pieces of code and data, potentially from several executables, either at compilation or load time.
Recall our [discussion of static vs dynamic linking](https://highassurance.rs/chp2/operational_assurance_2.html#building-a-free-standing-binary) from Chapter 2.
Either way, the end result of the loading looks roughly like so:

  <figcaption><center>Mapping of on-disk, executable contents to in-memory process space.</center></figcaption><br>
  </figure>
</p>

Because of an OS-provided abstraction called *virtual memory*, a process gets to assume its the only entity in a nearly limitless and entirely linear address space.
For all practical intents and purposes, its memory layout is the right-hand side of the diagram above.

Maintaining mappings from this virtual layout to physical storage shared by other processes is the job of the OS.
And a layer of complexity we can safely ignore in most day-to-day systems programming tasks.
Remember: a perfectly detailed model is seldom the most practical one, that's the beauty of abstraction design!

The most important takeaway from this section is that right side of the diagram.
Specifically how executable code, static memory, stack memory, and heap memory *co-exist* in the same process address space.
Both normal execution and program exploitation happen within the confines of this memory model.
This is what you'll be reasoning about when writing systems code.
It's important you commit it to memory, pun intended.

Forked process memory is copy-on-write.

## Takeaway

The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is a tiny state machine continually operating on main memory or Random Access Memory (RAM).
RAM stores both code and data.
A CPU fetches, decodes, and executes instructions from RAM (code), then writes back results (data) if applicable.

A program must be loaded into memory, creating a *process*, before it can run.
That involves mapping it's executable code into RAM and setting up 3 special memory locations:

1. Static memory - stores global variables and constants.
2. Stack memory - stores function frames, including local variables.
3. [Optionally] Heap memory - stores data shared between functions and threads.

We'll cover stack and static memory next.
In the context of a language, agnostic reliability pattern.
Heap memory will come a bit later!

[^Chp1Levels]: "Low-level" can be an ambiguous and overloaded term to apply to a programming language. We briefly explained our usage of the term in the ["Languages by Level"](https://highassurance.rs/chp1/why_this_book.html#languages-by-level) section of Chapter 1.

[^CustomAlloc]: Technically, Type-III systems *can* explicitly link in a custom allocator as part of the firmware build, essentially "bringing their own" heap support. But many, if not most, single-purpose devices won't do so - due to resource and/or reliability constraints.

[^T3]: For those curious: Type-III systems can have only one program, baked directly into Read-Only Memory (ROM), whose entry point is jumped to on device reset. Unlike general purpose systems, they don't require the flexibility of being able to run arbitrary executables. Hence they don't need the process abstractions we've diagramed above.

[^FixedLen]: This is true certain Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs), like 32 and 64-bit ARM, that use fixed length encoding. Other ISAs, like x86, use variable length encoding. For 64-bit x86, instructions vary from 1 byte to 15 bytes in length. As you might imagine, that variability creates challenges for software disassemblers.
