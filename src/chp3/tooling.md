# Recommended Tooling

Core language features, like ownership and modules, color the Rust development experience regardless of project size and scope.
The growing library ecosystem makes many ambitious projects feasible - we can leverage abstractions developed and maintained by others.
Built-in test support helps us build those bold projects with confidence.

There's a final, perhaps less glamorous, aspect of software engineering we need to cover: maintenance.
While smart use of modules can help us tame architectural complexity, even a well-organized project needs additional tools to maintain the health of its codebase.

In this section, we'll briefly cover the basics of Rust's 1st-party documentation, linting, code formatting, and build reproduction tools.
We'll also sample 3rd party utilities for miscellaneous tasks, like auditing dependencies for known vulnerabilities.

## 1st Party Tooling

### `rustdoc`

Rust has a built-in document generator, `rustdoc`[^RustDoc].
It's a default part of the toolchain and comes bundled along with `cargo`.
A special comment syntax allows you to write documentation, in Markdown[^Markdown], directly alongside code.
The benefit is twofold:

1. A **documentation website** can be rendered locally or served remotely. It's as comprehensive as your set of comments. That's a huge boon to library users.

2. Your documentation **examples are automatically run as unit tests**. This ensures that, any given time, the documentation is current - at least with respect to your provided examples. And it gains us a bit of momentum on building out a test suite.

To see `rustdoc` in action, let's create a new library:

```ignore
cargo new --lib prime_test
```

Running `tree prime_test` shows the following project layout.

```ignore
prime_test/
├── Cargo.toml
└── src
    └── lib.rs
```

Add the following to `lib.rs`:

```rust,noplaypen
{{#include ../../code_snippets/chp3/prime_test/src/lib.rs:prime_test}}
```

* The very first comment, prefixed with `//!`, provides documentation for the crate as a whole.

* The `count_primes` function, marked `pub`, is exported from the crate root (`lib.rs`). It's part of the public API.

    * The comments starting with three forward slashes (`///`) will be part of the rendered documentation.

    * `#[doc(alias = "primality")]` is a macro that tags the function with another keyword, so that users entering the relevant search term `primality` will see this function displayed in search results.

* `is_prime` is a private helper, it doesn't have the `pub` modifier for export and uses regular, non-document comments (lines starting with `//`).

Running `cargo test` will execute both unit tests we've written and all documentation examples.
To run the doc tests alone, we can use `cargo test --doc`:

```ignore
running 1 test
test src/lib.rs - count_primes (line 9) ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.16s
```

To render the documentation locally, run `cargo doc --open`.
The generated HTML/CSS/JavaScript webpage will be opened with the system's default browser.

A landing page shows crate-wide documentation and enumerates exported modules, structures, functions.
In our case, the only public item is the `count_primes` function.
Clicking on it leads to a documentation page showing our example:

</br>
<p align="center">
  <figure>
  <img width= "100%" src="count_primes_doc.png">
  <figcaption><center>The rendered documentation for our public function, viewed using the selectable dark theme.</center></figcaption><br>
  </figure>
</p>

Because `rustdoc` is used for standard library documentation, its format is already familiar to Rust developers.
Moreover, if you publish projects to [crates.io](https://crates.io/), Rust's official package repository, documentation for your project is automatically rendered and hosted at [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/), Rust's official documentation host.

The onus of writing clear and complete documentation is still on you, but the tooling and infrastructure eliminate barriers to getting docs into the hands of the users that need them.

Some additional tips:

* Should you want to enforce completeness across every exported item: adding the optional `#![deny(missing_docs)]` within the crate root makes missing documentation a compile-time error.

* If your code examples include boilerplate the user can assume is present, you can omit it from the rendered doc but still have it present during test execution by prefixing the line with `#`.

    * For instance, had our example for the `count_primes` function started with `# use prime_test::count_primes;`, the documentation wouldn't show this import line.

* Not every documentation example may be full standalone, runnable code. To have `cargo` check that an example compiles but not actually attempt to execute it as doc test, the code block be prefixed with `no_run` - added immediately after the three opening backticks. For code that shouldn't be compiled or run, `ignore` can similarly be used.

### `clippy`

`clippy` is an official code linting tool.
It's already installed in the book's container, but the typical setup would be:

```ignore
rustup update
rustup component add clippy
```

Per the `README.md` of `clippy`'s official source repo[^ClippyReadme], the tool supports over 500 lints across the following categories:

| Category              | Description                                                                         | Default level |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `clippy::all`         | All lints that are on by default (correctness, suspicious, style, complexity, perf) | **warn/deny** |
| `clippy::correctness` | Code that is outright wrong or useless                                              | **deny**      |
| `clippy::suspicious`  | Code that is most likely wrong or useless                                           | **warn**      |
| `clippy::style`       | Code that should be written in a more idiomatic way                                 | **warn**      |
| `clippy::complexity`  | Code that does something simple but in a complex way                                | **warn**      |
| `clippy::perf`        | Code that can be written to run faster                                              | **warn**      |
| `clippy::pedantic`    | Lints which are rather strict or have occasional false positives                    | allow         |
| `clippy::nursery`     | New lints that are still under development                                          | allow         |
| `clippy::cargo`       | Lints for the cargo manifest                                                        | allow         |

The full lint set has a searchable documentation site[^ClippyLints].

Notice that `clippy::correctness` can find actual bugs (as opposed to, say, unidiomatic but correct code pointed out by `clippy::style`).
However, only a small minority of correctness checks are precise enough to be applied confidently and automatically (e.g. `MachineApplicable`[^MachApp] rules).

To run `clippy` on the `prime_test` library with default settings:

```ignore
cd code_snippets/chp3/prime_test
cargo clippy
```

We'll get the following warning for the `if` block inside `count_primes` commented with `// Unnecessary, unidiomatic check`:

```ignore
warning: comparison to empty slice
  --> src/lib.rs:18:8
   |
18 |     if num_list == [] {
   |        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ help: using `is_empty` is clearer and more explicit: `num_list.is_empty()`
   |
   = note: `#[warn(clippy::comparison_to_empty)]` on by default
   = help: for further information visit https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#comparison_to_empty

warning: `prime_test` (lib) generated 1 warning
```

This warning is indeed helpful, using the more explicit `is_empty()` API makes our code easier to understand at a glance.
The warning will disappear if we update `count_primes` to:

```rust,ignore
pub fn count_primes(num_list: &[usize]) -> usize {
    if num_list.is_empty() {
        return 0;
    }

    num_list.iter().filter(|n| is_prime(**n)).count()
}
```

But linters have a limitation.
They *parse syntax*, they don't *understand semantics*.
Even though the more complex lints can make it appear that way.

In reality, we don't need the check because filtering an iterator (`.iter().filter(...)` in the above) already handles the empty-input edge case correctly.
This function could be a one-liner:

```rust,ignore
pub fn count_primes(num_list: &[usize]) -> usize {
    num_list.iter().filter(|n| is_prime(**n)).count()
}
```

Nonetheless, `clippy` is a powerful and useful tool for improving and maintaining general code quality.
And its lints regularly improve.
`clippy` makes a great addition to CI.

> **Aside on "Trojan Source" Attacks**
>
> One of the more esoteric lints in the `clippy::correctness` denies invisible Unicode characters in source files.
> While that eliminates potentially surprising edge cases, the Rust compiler itself now does linting to prevent "trojan source" attacks[^TrojanSource] - which use encoding tricks to produce source code that reads one way to a human (in terms of visible characters) but appears another way to the compiler (in terms of parsed tokens).
> This change was made in response to CVE-2021-42574[^SrcCVE], in which researchers reported the attack as a threat to supply-chain security.

### `rustfmt`

Unlike a linter, which checks for best practices and high-level idioms, `rustfmt` enforces low-level style rules.
Things like maximum line width, the number of allowed blank spaces between items, whether opening braces should be on the same line or the next, etc.

The individual rewrites applied for a given project are configurable[^RustFmt].
You can adjust style rules to suit your team's preferences.

Like `rustdoc`, `rustfmt` can be run with a `cargo` subcommand.
To apply the default ruleset:

```ignore
cargo fmt
```

In the case of our `prime_test` library example, the command would have no effect.
But for large, multi-developer codebases it can be an important way to ensure a baseline level of consistency and readability.

Like `clippy`, `rustfmt` is an ideal candidate for CI.
Code review can be more efficient when all commits conform to a uniform style.

### The `Cargo.lock` File

This last entry in the 1st party list isn't a standalone tool - rather an important feature of `cargo` we should discuss.

After running `cargo build` or `cargo run`, you may have noticed a new file appear alongside `Cargo.toml`: `Cargo.lock`.
Where as `Cargo.toml` is something you'll edit frequently (e.g. to add new dependencies), `Cargo.lock` is an auto-generated file containing metadata for reproducible builds[^CargoTomlVsLock].

It "locks in" a specific dependency version at build time.
You wouldn't want `cargo` to eagerly upgrade dependencies every time you build.

#### Reproducible Builds

For example, say you added a dependency on the `rayon` crate[^Rayon] to your `Cargo.toml` like so:

```ignore
[dependencies]
rayon = "^1.5"
```

Per the Cargo Book's guide to specifying dependencies[^CargoDep], this means the project can use any semantic version[^SemVer] of `rayon` that is greater than `1.5.0` but less than `2.0.0`.
Let's assume at the time you first built your project, the latest available version of `rayon` was `1.5.0`.
What happens when version `1.5.1` comes out?

Nothing.
The `Cargo.lock` file generated during that first build logged `1.5.0` as the version of `rayon` to use.
If you share a copy of the project directory with a co-worker, including the `Cargo.lock`, they'll be able to build the project using the exact same dependency versions as you.
Committing the `Cargo.lock` file to version control is a good idea for projects that build an executable, like Chapter 2's CLI tool.
So anyone can build an equivalent executable.

Additionally, you may choose to include `rust-toolchain.toml`[^ToolFile] file to ensure your co-worker uses the exact same compiler version and targets the same platform.

In theory, locking dependency versions shouldn't be necessary.
Semantic versioning dictates that `1.5.1` only contains fully-backward compatible bug fixes.
But that's a convention that can't be automatically enforced.
And software is complex, it's entirely possible for some minor bug fix to create a problem specific to your product or environment.
That's why reproducible builds are so important for production software.
Especially when it comes to Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).

When you are ready to update the latest dependency versions allowable by your `Cargo.toml`, simply run:

```ignore
cargo update
cargo test
```

The former command searches for new published versions and updates your `Cargo.lock`.
The latter runs your test suite.
Just in case.

#### Self-hosted Dependencies

Note that your dependencies do not need to be hosted on [crates.io](https://crates.io).
Chapter 2's CLI tool could have pulled `clap` directly from it's GitHub repository like so:

```ignore
[dependencies]
clap = { git = "https://github.com/clap-rs/clap.git", features = ["derive"] }
```

`git = ...` can be used for any Git repository URL, including private, self-hosted repositories maintained by your company or team.

Moreover, you can lock to a specific branch and commit hash manually:

```ignore
[dependencies]
clap = { git = "https://github.com/clap-rs/clap.git", branch = "master", rev = "31bd0b5", features = ["derive"] }
```

This is useful if you need to stay on a known-good version of an internal library, while still using `cargo update` to keep other dependencies tracking with upstream.

## 3rd Party Tooling

Built-in maintenance tools are the tip of the iceberg.
The ecosystem offers an array of additional capabilities, often bundled as plugins to `cargo`.
This means extending `cargo` with additional subcommands is as often easy as running `cargo install <name_of_tool>`.
Although some tools have additional setup steps.

We'll sample three different 3rd party plugins.
For the remainder of this section, we'll assume you're using the book's container - which has each pre-installed.
If not, please refer to the documentation of each individual tool (linked to in the footnotes).

### `cargo-modules`

When you need a quick overview of a large Rust project, `cargo-modules`[^CargoModules] can be handy.
It prints the modules hierarchy, including both internal and external APIs, to console.

Let's try it out on `clap`, the CLI argument parser we used in Chapter 2:

```ignore
git clone git@github.com:clap-rs/clap.git
cd clap/
cargo modules generate tree --with-types --package clap
```

You should see a color-coded printout starting with something akin to:

```ignore
crate clap
├── const INTERNAL_ERROR_MSG: pub(crate)
├── const INVALID_UTF8: pub(crate)
├── struct SubCommand: pub
├── mod build: pub(crate)
│   ├── mod app_settings: pub(self)
│   │   ├── struct AppFlags: pub
│   │   ├── enum AppSettings: pub
│   │   └── struct Flags: pub(self)
│   ├── mod arg: pub(self)
│   │   ├── struct Arg: pub
│   │   ├── enum ArgProvider: pub(crate)
│   │   ├── enum DisplayOrder: pub(crate)
│   │   ├── type Validator: pub(self)
│   │   ├── type ValidatorOs: pub(self)
│   │   └── fn display_arg_val: pub(crate)
...
```

### `cargo-audit`

Rust's crate ecosystem is something of a "double-edged sword":

* On one hand, `cargo` makes building and integrating external dependencies easy and fun (relative to traditional systems-software build tools, like GNU `make`[^GNUMake]).

* On the other, professional projects can quickly accumulate a staggering amount of dependencies. Many of which are transitive (dependency of a dependency).

While long compile times are a nuisance, the true downside of large dependency graphs is maintenance.
Just because you've updated to the latest version of a direct dependency doesn't mean its authors have done the same.
It's possible to, directly or indirectly, depend on crate versions with known security issues.

This is where `cargo-audit`[^CargoAudit], another `cargo` plugin, comes in.
It scans your entire dependency graph for known-vulnerable crate versions.
Using public data cataloged in the *Rust Security Advisory Database*[^RustSecDB], maintained by the Rust Secure Code Working Group[^RustSecWG].

We can audit the full dependency graph of Chapter 2's `rcli` tool.
Note we run the command from the workspace root, not the `rcli` folder:

```ignore
cd code_snippets/chp2/crypto_tool/
cargo audit
```

At the time of this writing, the scan loaded 399 security advisories (the signature data) and checked 29 dependencies (the full dependency graph):

```ignore
   Fetching advisory database from `https://github.com/RustSec/advisory-db.git`
      Loaded 399 security advisories (from /home/tb/.cargo/advisory-db)
    Updating crates.io index
    Scanning Cargo.lock for vulnerabilities (29 crate dependencies)
```

Remember the static/dynamic known/unknown quadrant from Chapter 2?
`cargo-audit` won't discover brand new bugs specific to your project, but it's an important health check for your dependencies.

Since our `rcli` project was fine, you might be curious what `cargo-audit`'s warning or error output looks like.
Here's a sample warning:

```ignore
Crate:         difference
Version:       2.0.0
Warning:       unmaintained
Title:         difference is unmaintained
Date:          2020-12-20
ID:            RUSTSEC-2020-0095
URL:           https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2020-0095
Dependency tree:
difference 2.0.0
└── predicates 1.0.8
```

### `cargo-binutils`

`cargo-binutils`[^CargoBinutils] is a wrapper for GNU Binutils[^GNUBinutils], a collection of command line tools for inspecting Linux binaries.
We won't enumerate every tool in the Binutils suite here.
To give you a feel - we can use the `size` subcommand to get the exact count bytes in every section of the output binary for Chapter 2's `rcli` tool:

```ignore
cd code_snippets/chp2/crypto_tool/rcli
cargo size --release -- -A
```

One specific line prints the size of the `.text` section, where ELF[^ELFSpec] binaries store executable code:

```ignore
section                   size     addr
.text                   598995   0x9080
```

The exact number reported will vary depending on your compiler version and host architecture.
In our case, `rcli` contains `599 kB` of executable code when built with optimizations (`--release`).

## Takeaway

1st party tooling lets us generate up-to-date documentation that doubles as a test suite, lint our code for the latest best-practice patterns, ensure consistent formatting across large development teams, and facilitate reproducible builds.

3rd party tools perform a range of auxiliary tasks.
The list above is just a sample of what's out in the ecosystem, with more tools and `cargo` plugins becoming available every year.

If you build production software in Rust, you're making investment in the language, toolchain, and ecosystem.
Ecosystem dependency versions are easy enough to mange, SemVer[^SemVer] numbers are configurable via `Cargo.toml`.
But what about the language itself?

We'll conclude this chapter by taking a brief look at the release cycle of the Rust toolchain.
Don't worry - changes are always backwards compatible, new versions won't break your code.
But understanding how Rust's versioning works is useful.
Whether you want to keep up with the latest-and-greatest or just keep the production ship sailing smoothly.
